<br>DATA SECURITY
<br>
<br>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. For example, when you provide sensitive information on our Platform, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
<br>
<br>We have signed up with Google Firebase server for better security to store all data. Although we make good faith efforts to store Personal Information in a secure operating environment that is not open to the public, you should understand that there is no such thing as complete security, and we do not guarantee that there will be no unintended disclosures of your Personal Information. If we become aware that your Personal Information has been disclosed in a manner not in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the nature and extent of the disclosure (to the extent we know that information) as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted by law.
<br>
<br>DATA RETENTION
<br>
<br>As a general rule, the personal data that is processed by us as set forth herein is not retained for longer than necessary for the purpose for which it was processed. More specifically, we retain and delete your personal data as follows:
<br>
<br>1. Registration, Usage data and Contact Data will be retained indefinitely for the purpose of monitoring the historical performance of our Platform.
<br>
<br>2. Your account related data will be retained for a period of 3 years after our last transaction with you, after which it will be deleted unless required for auditing or legal reasons.
<br>
<br>Notwithstanding the aforementioned, in some cases it is not possible for us to specify in advance the periods for which your personal data will be retained. In such cases, we will determine the period of retention based on the period we need to access the data for the provision of services, receiving payment, resolving business or other issues or any other auditing or legal reasons. Further, notwithstanding this section, we may retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.
<br>
<br>UPDATES AND CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY
<br>
<br>We may update this Privacy Policy at any time, with or without advance notice. In the event there are significant changes in the way we treat Vendor’s personally identifiable information, or in the Privacy Policy itself, we will display a notice on the Platform or send Vendors an email, as provided for above, so that you may review the changed terms prior to continuing to use the Services.
<br>
