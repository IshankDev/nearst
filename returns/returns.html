    <h3>Returns & Refund Policy:</h3>

Every product on our platform is sold by small and medium retailers from around India. Each retailer can choose to offer either a standard 7-day return policy or opt to not offer a product for return. The said details would be visible under the tab of Returns & Replacement under the product detail page. <br>
For items where the seller has agreed to enable a 7-day return policy, provided that you<b> don't use the product and preserve its original condition, tags, and packaging.</b> You can try our products but please take adequate measures to preserve their original condition. <br>
We offer a free pick-up service from the address to which the product was originally delivered. For the return of orders picked up from a store, our customer executives would contact you about a pick-up location. <br>
Most of our sellers are proud middle-class Indians, much like you. Every time a product is wrongly returned (maybe you wanted to try out different sizes just to see what works for you) our sellers incur a small loss. Thus, in all fairness to them, please shop products which you are decently confident about or you can always call our sellers and request them to keep a particular product aside for your next store visit!<br>
You can always return to shopping from our app once you‚Äôve seen the quality of our sellers firsthand.  üòÅ<br>
Please understand the following key terms & conditions:<br>
<ul>
<li>Our sellers are local stores, not large brands or distant wholesalers. We value them as equal partners on our platform. Thus, once a product has been picked up for return and delivered to the respective store, the seller would be able to raise a dispute not accepting the return request. In such cases, after inspection from Nearst, appropriate steps would be taken at the sole discretion of the company (Nearst). If no dispute has been registered, the total refund amount will be transferred to the customer‚Äôs bank account within 3 days.</li>
<li>During Pick Up, our delivery agent may do a quality check on the return. For a successful pick up, </li>
<li>If the returned product does not pass the quality check (if it has been used, washed, altered, or without original tags etc.,), we shall ship it back to you.</li>
<li>All items to be returned must be unused, unwashed, unaltered and in their original condition with all original tags and packaging intact (for e.g. shoes must be packed in the original shoe box).</li>
<li>In case you are buying Silk Sarees, you would be required to return the product with the correct fold so as to retain the originality of the product</li>
<li>In case you have purchased an item which has a free gift/offer associated with it and you wish to return the main item, then you will have to return the free product as well.</li>
<li>Nearst will not be liable for the products returned by mistake. In circumstances where an extra or a different product is returned by mistake, Nearst would not be accountable for misplacement or replacement of the product and is not responsible for its delivery back to the User</li>
<li>We make three attempts to pick up the item, if the item is not picked up in the third attempt, Pickup request will be marked as failed. You can initiate a new return request, if item meets the return criteria and is within the specified return/exchange period (check product details page for the same). For more details, please call our customer care.</li>
</ul>
Please note: Some sellers may choose to offer a no-return policy for certain products (this option is product specific and not seller specific), please note this on the product detail page before placing orders.<br>
